### Hi there 👋

I currently work at Ollion, Inc. I am a Senior Cloud Consultant who has been in the IT industry for more that 20 years. I enjoy learning and messing aronud with various technologies. Most of my free time belongs to my family, however when I get a moment to focus on my hobbies they will be reflected in my repositories or over at my new blog [overengineered.cloud](https://overengineered.cloud).
